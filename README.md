# Javascript based Web3 App 

This project demonstrates how to create a minimalistic html Web3 Application built using html and javascript only. It comes with a web page where you could do transaction like Fund, Withdraw, Balance on the fundMe project that is already created and uploaded to git in other repo. 
 
To run the project open the project in vscode and install the Live Server extension and then click on Go Live button given in the tray. The home page will get open where you could see the Fund, balance and other such buttons. Make sure to have Metamask extension installed in your browser.
